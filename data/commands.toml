# This file contains the list of commmands you can type in the mud, and what the in-game
# command names are.  Command names cannot be duplicated (there will be an error at
# startup if you do.)  Exit directions take precedence over command names, so
# keep that in mind when naming commands and directions.

Command = "who"
# you can leave out aliases if you don't want to specify them for a command.
Help = "show a list of logged-on players"

[Tell]
