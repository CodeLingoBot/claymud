    # clean up old log files.

    # filename controls where the log file is written. By default logs are
    # written to the ClayMUD data directory in a subdirectory called logs in a
    # file called mud.log.  You may uncomment this setting to change the
    # default. filename = "/path/to/your/foo.log"
