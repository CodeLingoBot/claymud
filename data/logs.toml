# This is the configuration file for how logs behave in NateMUD.  NateMUD uses a
# rolling/rotating log system.  What that means is, once the current log file
# gets too big, NateMUD will create a new file to log to and optionally clean up
# old log files.

# filename controls where the log file is written. By default logs are written
# to the NateMUD data directory in a subdirectory called logs in a file called
# natemud.log.  You may uncomment this setting to change the default.
# filename = "/path/to/your/foo.log"

# maxsize is the maximum size in megabytes of the logfile before it gets
# rotated.
maxsize = 100

# maxbackups controls how many old log files are allowed to be retained.  If 0
# or not specified, there's no maximum on the number of log files that are
# retained.
maxbackups = 3

# maxage is the cutoff for deleting old log files based on their last modified
# date.  Note that the last modified date will almost certainly be different
# than the date encoded in the log file's name.  If 0 or not specified, there's
# no maximum age for old log files.
maxage = 365

# localtime, if true, causes the log file name to use the local time for the
# format.  If false or not specified, UTC time will be used.
localtime = true
