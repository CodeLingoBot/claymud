# This is an example emote configuration file.  For those that know what it
# means, it is written in TOML. If you don't know what that means, don't worry,
# it's easy to figure out.
# 
# Each emote starts with the section header [[emote]].  Under that you define
# the emote's name.  Note that names must be unique.
# 
# Below that, there are three sub-sections, which may exist in any order. Each
# section defines the behavior of the emote when it is used in a particular way.
# 
# ToSelf is what happens when you use an emote targetted at yourself. 
# For example, "smile <myname>"
# 
# ToNoOne is what happens when you use an emote without a target.
# For example "smile"
# 
# ToOther is what happens when you use an emote with a target that is not you.
# For example "smile Bob".  In this case, the target would be Bob.
#
# If you leave out a sub-section, you effectively disable using the emote in
# that way, and if someone tries to use the emote in that way, they will get a
# message like "You cannot do that."  This is useful for emotes that don't make
# sense in certain circumstances.
#
# Each section has values which are templates for the text that will be output
# to people in the same location as the person performing the emote.
#
# self   - The text to output to the person performing the emote.
# target - The text to output to the person who was the target of the emote. 
#          (only applicable in the ToOther section)
# around - The text to output to everyone else in the room. 
#          (not including the person performing the action, or the target if 
#          there is one)
#
# There are a few special fields that you can put into emote text, which will be
# filled out with data from the game, all are enclosed in double squiggly
# braces and start with a period, for example: {{.Actor}}.  Note that these are 
# case sensitive.
#
# Actor  - The name of the person performing the emote.
# Target - The name of the target of the emote.
#          (this value is only usable in the ToOther section).
# Xself  - "himself", "herself", or "itself" 
#          (depending on the gender of the person performing the emote)
