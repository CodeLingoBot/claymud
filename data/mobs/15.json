            "DetailedDesc": "He takes his job very seriously.  He appears tired from his long shift of pacing\nthe museum floors.  Eventhough his patience has worn thin towards the end of shift,\nhe loves his job here among the tributes to the gods.  He carries a gun at his side\nand has had to use it from time to time.  His hat is tipped back and his jacket a\nbit too small.  He doesn't look all that alert, but he knows this museum like the\nback of his own hand.  If something is out of place he will know.\n",
