Moving out of home 1991 to attend Montgomery College in Rockville, she \nstudied video production. After saving money she earned as the videographer of countless\nweddings, she planned her first major project - a documentary on the story of her\ngreat-grandmothers that both fascinated and frightened her the most. The story that\nresurfaced so often in both history and her own mind - the legend of the Blair Witch.\n",
