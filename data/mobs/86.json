She is\nalso one of two gods that was granted immortality after the Time of \nTroubles. In her mortal life she retrieved the Tablets of Fate, which then\nallowed the gods to regain their rightful positions in the heavens, after\nthe overgod Ao had cast them out. She has knowledge of every spell\never cast by any mage or cleric throughout all of history, and can cast\nany of them at will. Her power is so great that she is not permitted to\nretain it all herself, and thus stores much of it in her Chosen. If not for\nthis precaution, she would easily be a match for the overgod himself.\n",
