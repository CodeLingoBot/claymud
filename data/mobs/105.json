His name was Ancalador.  Many heroes came\r\r\r\r\n\r\tto do battle with him, but all failed and died, horribly,\r\r\r\r\n\r\tI imagine.  But one wizard challenged the Drake to a magic\r\r\r\r\n\r\tduel.  He too died, like the others, but with his last\r\r\r\r\n\r\tbreath, the wizard turned the mighty Ancalador to stone!\r\r\r\r\n\r\tMany believed the dragon's evil reign ended, but after the\r\r\r\r\n\r\tdancing and drinking were over, and life returned to its\r\r\r\r\n\r\tquiet pace, the people began to notice that the Dragon's\r\r\r\r\n\r\tpresence could still be felt.  Ancalador did, in fact,\r\r\r\r\n\r\tcontinue to rule from his petrified prison through the \r\r\r\r\n\r\tmanipulation of the minds of men.  Indeed, he has done so\r\r\r\r\n\r\tto this day.  Many believe he is plotting the day he can\r\r\r\r\n\r\treturn in the flesh, so to speak...\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\n\rWith that the Hermit begins to cackle madly, tears running down his\r\r\r\r\n\rleathery face.
