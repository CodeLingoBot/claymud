Though he could use his magic\nto take over the world, he is wise enough to know that such action would tear\nthe Realms apart, thus he spends his power in thwarting such schemes made by\nothers, most notably the Zhentarim, led by their High Lord, Manshoon. In fact,\nElminster can boast of having killed Manshoon more times than anyone else (23\ntimes in fact, due to Manshoon's habit of being brought back to life in\nclones). Were it not for the intervention of Elminster, the Realms would have\nbeen destroyed on several occasions. \n",
