There are a few windows with\ntheir wooden shutters closed against the cool night air.  On the closed oak\ndoor in front of you, there is a strange symbol, which looks like the letters\nM and K pushed together. You deduce from the symbol and the sounds of roudy\nmen inside, that this must be the barracks.  MidKnight's highly trained\nsoldiers reside here when they are not training or out doing battle.\n",

A huge oak tree towers in one\ncorner, a stone bench taking advantage of the shade underneath it.  Violets,\nlilacs, roses, and a hundred other flowers you can't put names to grow\neverywhere. In the center of a circle of stones roughly in the middle of the\ngarden there is a small fountain gently gurgling.  The peacefulness and quiet\nof this place is a stark contrast to the forboding you felt in the rest of\nthe castle.  Someone obviously spent a lot of time (and magic) in the upkeep\nof this place.\n",

There are two large oak\ntables standing in the center of the library, probably for laying the\nextensive collection of maps MidKnight has collected.  The ceiling is almost\nfifteen feet high in here, and because of that, there is a ladder hooked to a\ntrack that runs around the edge of the room, for getting to the shelves too\nhigh to reach from the floor.  Interspersed throughout the books are bookends\nand statuettes from all over the world.  Truly this is as fine a library as\nanyone could ask for.\n",

This one is well lit and spacious,\ndivided into two parts, one is partitioned off by bookshelves filled with\nlittle girls' toys.  On the other side of the shelves is a typical young\ngirl's bedroom, everything pink with ruffles on the bed, dolls all over the\nplace, even a dresser sized just right for a child of that age.  The other\npart of the room is quite large, huge in fact, compared to most rooms.  One\nof the strangest things is, it's covered in green grass.  There is a small\nstable, with room enough for two ponies, with all the gear and food that go\nalong with horses.  Through some kind of magic, it is also open to the sky,\nnot the dark sky of MidKnight's world, but a normal, partly cloudy sky of the\nnormal world. Surely this must be any girl's dream come true.\n",

Something small and furry scuttles into a tiny\nhole at the base of the wall across from you.  Looking around, you realize\nit's either back through the tunnel or straight up.\n",
