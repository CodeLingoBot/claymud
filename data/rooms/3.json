Hundreds of millions died and all of the cities were in ruins.\nLooters, scavengers, and murderers were left free to do whatever they wished\nand there were no one to stop them.  The US government was losing control\nover its armies as they were tempted themselves to start raping cities for\nfood and other valuables.  The situation became so bad that the superheroes\nplanned a truce with their super-nemesis to help rebuild America and to\nrestore a new government controlled by both parties.  It was an unlikely\nalliance but amazingly the plan worked out well.  Metro-Gotham is now the\nlargest city in the world, covering almost half of North America.  The name\n'Metro-Gotham' was given to this city in honor of the two great cities,\nMetropolis and Gotham, which were destroyed instantly by the earthquake.\n"
