An altar rests\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rupon a dias on which sets a huge glowing green gem with a golden hilted\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rsword forced into it. The gem pulsates and changes in varying patterns\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rand shades of green. You hear an audible sigh from some large creature.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r",
