The ranger is also\r\r\r\r\n\rchecking to see if you have the qualifications to enter this\r\r\r\r\n\rforest-land because of the level restrictions to enter this\r\r\r\r\n\rarea.  You can see the grand forest from outside the gates.  The\r\r\r\r\n\rlush, green plants and trees from the distance is just splendid\r\r\r\r\n\rand the smell of fresh pine is everywhere.  There are animals\r\r\r\r\n\rthere running and pouncing happily as though they have nothing to\r\r\r\r\n\rfear.  This beautiful forest lights up as the sun begins to rise\r\r\r\r\n\rfrom a distance.\r\r\r\r\n\r",
