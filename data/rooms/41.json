Looking around, you see a large group of short, broad\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rpeople chipping away at the stone with picks. They appear to be dwarves,\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rbut they have different complexions from the dwarves you have encountered\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rbefore. As your light source illuminates the room, some of them cry out in\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rpain and drop their tools. At the sound of this, another group of them\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rdecide to rush you. Whoops...\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r",
