If you are one who feels the\nneed to be heroic and are willing to sacrifice yourself for the\ngood of others, then perhaps you should become a paladin. The old\norder of paladins accepts commoners and nobles alike these days,\nso you needn't worry about your social position. Anyone who wishes\nto follow the path of honor and nobility may join the ranks of the\npaladins.\n",
