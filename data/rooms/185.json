Many come to pray to Ruthia, goddess of luck, to bring\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rhappiness in some form or another. Many gods have visited these temples,\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rshrines of thier existence. Long has it been known that to kill or\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\renter into a sacred place with evil intention brings instant death to\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rthose who dare oppose the unwritten law. The Midkemian gods do not\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rtake kindly to insubordination, or the desecration of thier subject's\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rplace of worship. Be wary here, and pure of heart, or fate will suffer\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\ryou no longer. A feeling of peace permeates the very structure here.\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r",
