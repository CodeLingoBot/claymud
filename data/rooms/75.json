Go NORTH and you will find our beautiful Martian City.\r\r\r\r\n\r*  To the WEST, there is nothing...just a lot of sand dunes and\r\r\r\r\n\r   desert lands.  For centuries, we have not explore this area on\r\r\r\r\n\r   Mars.  It is highly unrecommended that you go there.  There \r\r\r\r\n\r   are sandtraps that are hidden everywhere...\r\r\r\r\n\r*  If you like to go sight seeing, we suggest you go EAST and\r\r\r\r\n\r   visit the Martian mines.  You can witness how we mine our \r\r\r\r\n\r   precious mineral resources.  Warning to all tourists:  Please\r\r\r\r\n\r   do not wander into any unexplore caves in that area.\r\r\r\r\n\r*  It is forbidden for anyone to go SOUTH of here unless of\r\r\r\r\n\r   course, you are an official of the Martian Counsel or a\r\r\r\r\n\r   military officer of our prestigious army.  Trespassers will\r\r\r\r\n\r   be sentenced to IMMEDIATE DEATH!  We will protect our emperor\r\r\r\r\n\r   with extreme measures, so be warned.\r\r\r\r\n\r"

You can hear the security \r\r\r\r\n\rcameras turning to your direction.  The alarms begin to sound and\r\r\r\r\n\rthe NASA security guards are headed your way.  You got nowhere\r\r\r\r\n\rto go, nowhere to run.  The main door from where you enter has\r\r\r\r\n\rbeen automatically closed and cannot be reopened.  You think\r\r\r\r\n\rto yourself -- hmmm, mind as well just look around, the guards\r\r\r\r\n\rwouldn't catch up to me that quickly.  As you walk along the\r\r\r\r\n\rhalls, you notice a strange-looking man standing next to a large\r\r\r\r\n\rwindow.  He doesn't look like he works here and his outfit...it\r\r\r\r\n\rseems to glow as though it has been bombarded with lethal \r\r\r\r\n\rradiation.  Suddenly...the stranger looks at you.  He smiles and \r\r\r\r\n\rthen asks you, 'Want to go where no man has gone before?  Give\r\r\r\r\n\rme some money and I'll send you afar!'\r\r\r\r\n\r",
