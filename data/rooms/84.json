The city sprawls on for miles, it seems, and\r\r\r\r\r\n\rthe population must be incredible. All around you are people who have\r\r\r\r\r\n\rcome to this city for trade, travel, and pleasure, and more than a few\r\r\r\r\r\n\rwho are here for less inicent reasons. Waterdeep is still a frontier city\r\r\r\r\r\n\rin some ways. Those who feel a need for adventure can still find it, and\r\r\r\r\r\n\rmany look for it. You can separate the adventures on the street from the\r\r\r\r\r\n\rguardsman and thugs easily; adventurers like yourself tend to stand out\r\r\r\r\r\n\rin a crowd. If too many of these sort of people got out of hand, it would\r\r\r\r\r\n\rbe more than the city guard could handle. \r\r\r\r\r\n\r      But toward the southern side of the city you see why Waterdeep has\r\r\r\r\r\n\rremained safe and prosperous...Blackstaff Tower. The tower is home to the\r\r\r\r\r\n\rLord Mage of Waterdeep, Khelben Arunsun, known as the \"Blackstaff.\"\r\r\r\r\r\n\r",

Those who enter through the gate\r\r\r\r\r\n\rseem none the worse for the experience, and often come bearing carts\r\r\r\r\r\n\rloaded with goods from the far North. You start to wonder just how safe\r\r\r\r\r\n\rthe northern roads are though, when you notice that every caravan leaving\r\r\r\r\r\n\rthe city takes with it several well-armed guards, and that the caravans\r\r\r\r\r\n\rreturning seem to have fewer, in general, than the ones leaving.\r\r\r\r\r\n\r",

However, during Bruenor's initial exploration\r\r\r\r\r\n\rof the Halls, a group of Duergar destroyed the bridge...the only way across.\r\r\r\r\r\n\rEver since then, there has been little reason to come here.\r\r\r\r\r\n\r    The walls of the gorge are nearly sheer, but if you were reeeeaaaally\r\r\r\r\r\n\rcareful, you might be able to climb down. \r\r\r\r\r\n\r",
