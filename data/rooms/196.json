            "Description": "Here, next to the Mysidian sea, a robust sea breeze blows your hair about and\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rgives you a slight chill. The sea lies to your south, and the smooth shoreline\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rcontinues east and west of here. Further east, you can see that the shorline\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\reventually dips south, forming the famous Mysidian bay - the subject of many\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rlegends. A small, weathered path leads north, where it eventually enters\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rMysidia itself. It is also possible to travel east along the shoreline,\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rhowever there is no road leading in this direction. The soil here is moist\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rfrom its proximity to the sea, and the smell of the ocean is ever-present. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r",

            "Description": "Mysidia is a very rural village. The small town is surrounded by trees, and\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rmost of the buildings are built right on the grass. The buildings are all made\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rof some sort of white stone, made into bricks. Right now, you stand in some\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rsort of village square. One of the few places with pavement in this village,\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rthe square is actually a circle of road convieniently located between all the\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rbuildings. Mages and wizards hustle about here, running errands or simply\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\renjoying a walk. The air here is clean and fresh, probably something enspelled\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rby the mages here. The circle turns into a single paved path leading north up\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rsome steps to a very large building. The large building is easily the most\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rprominent building in the whole village. South of here, a small path leads out\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rof the town down to the seashore. Other exits lead to various other parts of\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\rthe city, including shops, an inn and cafe, and the famous Serpent Road. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n\r",
