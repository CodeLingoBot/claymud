And if you encounter\nany screwy persons who say their name, but when you fight them, their names\nare in opposite order, don't mind that, it's just that in japanese, people\nsay their names last name first, but here, they say first name first.  It\nwas done this way to preserve the feeling of the japanese, but stil have it\naccessible for us U.S. guys.  Other than that, please try out the zone, and\nif you can, watch the video's, their well worth your time.\n"
