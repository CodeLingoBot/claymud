In the middle of the room, you see a pile of ashes that looks like \nit once was a body and Froboz is is busy making adjustments on a new type of \nmagic wand .... possibly the one responsible for the explosion a few minutes \nago.  He removes a jeweler's loupe from his eye as he turns around.  \"How in \nthe name of Merlin did you get in here??!!\" he asks.  \"Oh, nevermind!  Since \nyou are here, you can serve as witnesses to the final test of the new mage's \nspell:  'ectowatt'.\"  With this he makes a magical gesture and the Paladin \nKnight appears.  Crossing his fingers, Froboz waves the wand his direction and \nwhat happens next is incredible!  The Paladin is enveloped in what appears to \nbe a small, well contained, thermonuclear explosion.  When the smoke clears \nyou can see that the Paladin and all of equipment has been reduced to a large \npile of flaming cinders.  Froboz throws his head back and cackles with insane \nglee.  \"Now, my young friends, what can I do for you?\" he asks.\n",
