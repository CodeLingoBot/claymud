            "Description": "You are standing in a huge hall.  There are displays all around of the\nworld's finest artwork.  Paintings, sculptures, pottery, every kind of art\nimaginable.  This must truly be the work of the gods.  Only they could\ncompile such a vast assortment of artwork. The styles range from crude\ndrawings such as those found on cave walls, to hyper-realistic three\ndimensional holograms.  After staring in awe for minutes, you finally take in\nthe rest of the room.  The walls are granite, but the ceiling is glass, open\nto the sky.  High above you, you can see birds soaring through the air. From\nthis room there are two doorways leading to the exhibits of the greater gods,\nand a huge staircase that leads up and out of sight.\n",

Stars stretch out in every direction for as far as the\neye can see, and the moon shines down, keeping watch over all the sleeping\nworld.

In\nthe corner is MidKnight's computer desk, with a seven pointed star hanging in\nthe air over it.  MidKnight walks around his domicile, not noticing the lack\nof light.\n",

They seem to be guarding a flight of stairs going even\nfurther up into the museum.  From what you can tell, the stairs go up the\nfinal distance to the main hall, where the exhibit to the greater gods is.\nThere is a door in the west wall, just like in the exhibit below, with a sign\nover it.  The sign reads: \"Visitor's Area.  If you leave this room through\nthis exit, you will have to go back down to the first exhibit of the lower\ngods before being allowed to do violence.\"\n",
